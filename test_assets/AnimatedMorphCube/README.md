# Animated Morph Cube

## Screenshot

![screenshot](screenshot/screenshot.gif)

## Description

The cube contains two morph targets in it:

  * **`thin`** : moves the vertices so that it becomes super-thin 
  * **`angle`** : moves the vertices so that it forms a ramp

The animation loops, morphing between these two states.

## Potential Issue: Animation in Blender
After loading the file in Blender, I see the animation timeline show up but there are no keyframes or mesh data. This animation plays as expected in Preview and Xcode. I'm not sure if it's expected to fail in Blender in this way or not
