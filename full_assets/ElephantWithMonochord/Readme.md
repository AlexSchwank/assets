## Description

This production model is designed for Augmented Reality playback via Apple's QuickLook.  
It contains both Skeletal Animation on two meshes (elephant and monochord) as well as [UsdAudio](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/wp_usdaudio.html) data.  

## Shading

The model uses the same texture for `diffuseColor` and `emission`. This creates an apperance of being "unlit", with no actual Unlit shading model currently being available in QuickLook.  

## Problem: Audio plays faster/slower

Some viewers ignore audio bitrate and instead assume a specific bitrate. The MP3 used here is an 48KHz file; QuickLook always assumes 48KHz, so 44.1KHz files will play incorrectly.  

## Problem: Only one mesh plays skeletal animation

## Known Issue: Bounds calculations

This model may have incorrect extents. Some viewers may calculate new mesh bounds from the actual skinned data / bones, others may use the provided extents data and thus show only a small part by default.
